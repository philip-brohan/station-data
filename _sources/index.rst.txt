Weather observations from station archives
============================================

Everything we know about past climate change and variability depends on access to historical observations of past weather.

There are many historical observations not yet available to science. Most of these exist only in printed form in libraries and archives - to make those available to science, we need to transcribe them, convert them into modern standard formats, and make them available for inclusion in standard databases. That's what we are doing here: We find old reports containing weather observations that we want, but are not yet in digital form, and transcribe and convert the observations.
